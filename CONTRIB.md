# Contribution guide

## Purporses of commit

1. Your commit should provide some improvement for widely-used systems.
2. Any bugfix is ok

## Code of conduct

1. Be tolerant to other's failure. Nobody is perfect. Me too.
2. Don't blame anyone. Nor in commit message nor in comments or code itself.
3. No PoC - no merge. Prepare yourself for questions.
4. Don't hesitate ask those questions too.

## Coding style

1. Use camelCase naming style.
2. Don't make methods & variables visible unless it's highly necessary.
3. Avoid using 3pc libraries for generic functions (collections, string parsing, etc).
We don't want to become a hostages of those libraries once.
